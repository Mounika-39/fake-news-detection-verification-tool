## 🚀 Key Features

✨ AI-powered fake news classification
✨ Real-time credibility scoring
✨ Clean and responsive user interface
✨ Secure authentication system
✨ Dashboard with analysis history
✨ Admin monitoring capabilities
✨ Optimized NLP pipeline for faster predictions

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
User → Web Interface → Flask Backend → NLP Pipeline → ML Model → Database → Dashboard
```

### ⚙️ Working Flow

1. User submits news text or URL
2. Backend preprocesses the data
3. NLP extracts meaningful patterns
4. Machine Learning model predicts authenticity
5. Credibility score is generated
6. Results stored in database
7. Output displayed on interactive dashboard
